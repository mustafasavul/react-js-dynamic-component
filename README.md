# React.js JSON Parser & Create Dynamic Component

This project is prepared simply to show that a certain JSON Component structure will be dynamically rendered on a page by parsing it in React.js. Don't take rules like CSS syntax seriously. Those parts should be shaped according to your wishes in your project.

You can make nested components. You can shape it with your own container and grid structure.
